# YouTube Playlist Downloader & MP3 Converter

This Python app downloads all songs from a YouTube playlist using `yt-dlp`. It automatically converts audio files not in MP3 format (like `.webm`) to MP3 using FFmpeg. A batch script is included to convert existing `.webm` files to `.mp3` in bulk.

**Requirements:** Python, `yt-dlp`, FFmpeg (must be installed and added to PATH).

Run the script, enter the playlist URL, and it handles downloading and conversion for you.
